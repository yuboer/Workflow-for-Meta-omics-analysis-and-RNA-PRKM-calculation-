# Workflow-for-Meta-omics-analysis-and-RNA-PRKM-calculation-
This repository serves as a step-by-step summary of the meta-omics analysis workflow and also the scripts for the RNA-RPKM calculation of my recent meta-omics analysis, and the paper "Integrated Omics Analyses Reveal Differential Gene Expression and Potential for Cooperation Between Denitrifying Polyphosphate and Glycogen Accumulating Organisms" could be found in the following link https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33769674/
